1. Cannot handle a vehicle w/ only 1 ECU
2. A LOT of validation is not currently being done
3. Uploading a file (update image) for ECU: Currently, we're expecting (thus require) the update to be in the following directory:
    uptane_web_app > applications > UPTANE > test_uploads
4. If an error is experienced with interfacing w/ 'nyu uptane' via write_[director||supplier]_repo() or even dp.clean_slate() \
    it must be noted that the servers will need to be killed then reinvoked, b/c if not then, creating a new vehicle will \
    NOT create the 3 directories that are normally created (missing metadata directory)- i.e., it gets in this real weird state...
5. Running into an error when trying to add a second vehicle via interface
    - 'nyu uptane' is not creating the metadata/ directory thus running into issues...
